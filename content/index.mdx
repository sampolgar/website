I'm Sam Polgar, I'm a PhD student at The University of Sydney in the Sydney Algorithms
and Theory group and Sydney Quantum Academy working on statistical analysis/verification
of large datasets and verified ML training using techniques from Cryptography (Zero
Knowledge/Interactive Proofs), Learning Theory, and Quantum Computing. I couldn't
be luckier to have two magnificent supervisors, Clément Canonne (primary) and Sri
Aravinda Krishnan Thyagaragan.

I completed my MPhil at USYD working on Anonymous Credentials and Zero Knowledge Proofs / Proofs of Knowledge, while working with a now defunct Crypto startup in the same field (Sismo). I completed my undergraduate at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) over 6 years part-time while I worked my way up from IT Helpdesk to a lead engineer at a small software company.

I enjoy endurance sports, particularly running. This year I finished the 100 Mile, 8500m elevation Elephant Trail Race after 2 x DNF in the distance and came 2nd.

## Extended

1. my first career was a chef, having worked nights and weekends during high school, I spent a memorable 3 years finishing my apprenticeship at one of Australia's best restaurants: Marque Restaurant, (now closed) awarded best restaurant in Australia, #67 in the world.
2. My second career, short-lived, was a 2 year stint to be a DJ in London and Berlin, I was playing in bars/pubs but ran out of money and returned home to my parents house.
3. I started studying physics and in parallel started playing with startups, one of them received seed funding and I did that for 2 years in Melbourne before running out of money, and returning to live with my parents house (again).
4. I then started computer science at UTS and an IT help desk role to pay off some debt.
5. After graduating, I worked for a year and had enough money to rethink my life direction and started research in computer science. Yet again, I returned to live with my parents... I also ran out of money again.
6. I found a beautiful wife along the way.
