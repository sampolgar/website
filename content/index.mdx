I'm Sam Polgar, I'm a PhD student at The University of Sydney in the Sydney Algorithms
and Theory group working on problems in Randomized Algorithms, Zero Knowledge Proofs,
Large Dataset Analysis, Learning Theory, and Quantum (yes, all the buzzwords). I'm
extremely lucky to have two magnificent supervisors, Clément Canonne (primary) and
Sri Aravinda Krishnan Thyagaragan.

I completed my MPhil at USYD working on Anonymous Credentials and Zero Knowledge Proofs / Proofs of Knowledge, while working with a now defunct Crypto startup in the same field (Sismo). I completed my undergraduate at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) over 6 years part-time while I worked my way up from IT Helpdesk to a lead engineer at a small software company.

Prior to dedicating my life to mathematics and computer science, my first career was a chef, having worked nights and weekends during high school, I spent a memorable 3 years finishing my apprenticeship at one of Australia's best restaurants: Marque Restaurant, (now closed) awarded best restaurant in Australia, #67 in the world. My second career, short-lived, was a 2 year stint to be a DJ in London and Berlin, I was playing in bars/pubs but ran out of money and returned home to my parents house. I started studying physics and in parallel started playing with startups, one of them received seed funding and I did that for 2 years in Melbourne before running out of money, and returning to live with my parents house (again). I then started computer science at UTS and an IT help desk role to pay off some debt. After graduating, I worked for a year and had enough money to rethink my life direction and started research in computer science. Yet again, I returned to live with my parents... I also ran out of money again. I somehow found a beautiful wife along the way.
