Difference between backend and frontend

Backend request cycle
- ⁠Authentication
- ⁠Authorization
- ⁠Request deserialization (= implicit in NodeJS / dynamic languages)
- ⁠Request validation
- ⁠Retrieve relevant domain objects
- ⁠Business rules
- ⁠Side effects (not just storing in DB, but sending email, calling other external service, etc)
- ⁠Map data model to API response

Frontend cannot be trusted, backend is trusted

Should a backend be separated to a frontend?
- different responsibilities
- deploy backend = riskier than frontend
- effort to deploy either 
- separate means different interfaces can be compatible (mobile app, etc)
