# Palate

### Website [link](https://palate.sampolgar.com)

Palate started out as an NFT minting website for winemakers to connect physical bottles of wine with on-chain certificates with the goal of
transferring ownership of the wine to the buyer.

I'd seen some of the biggest names in wine using NFT's - Penfolds, Robert Mondavi, Yao Family Wines (maybe not the biggest name in wine, but Yao Ming is big), and boutique producers from the most expensive wine regions in the world - Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair from Burgundy, Chateu Angelus from Bordeaux and Jezreel Valley Wines from Israel.

## Inspiration

I was inspired by the idea of creating a platform that would allow winemakers to track bottles through the supply chain and increase liquidity.

After heavily researching the space and speaking to the wine industry including vineyards, winemakers, wine collectors, and somelliers I realized

1. NFT's were largely used to increase the perceived value of wine and attract new buyers from different markets - the tool they'd need is an NFT minting website, perhaps
   tailored to the wine industry. Looking into a few of the NFT websites, I didn't see a differentiating factor worthy of pursuing
2. Making NFT minting websites wasn't inline with my ambition to build the underlying infrastructure for wine authenticity, provenance, and storage condition guarantees.
   That still excites me, I believe it requires a long time (as the technology needs to be built into the supply chain) and a hard sell to vineyards and winemakers that are happy with selling their wine as is

I wrote about the journey in great detail here: [website](https://palate.sampolgar.com)

If you're interested in pursuing the opportunity, I'm happy to share any further info I may have.
