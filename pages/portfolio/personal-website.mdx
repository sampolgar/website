# Personal Website

## Requirements

- About

- Site search (optional but helpful)
- Dark mode (optional but cool)
- TailwindCSS (optional but helpful)
- Tech: React & NextJS preferrably

## Overview

There's a ton of static site builders - gatsby, hugo, jekyll, docusaurus, etc. I wanted static site because I wanted to host it myself, send people to my space (instead of Medium) and wanted everything in Markdown.

I wanted to use React to sink my teeth into it after some time away. I read about NextJS often and thought it would work well for the page routing, styling, and a few features I'll talk about below.

I initially used my own CSS as I hadn't played with TailwindCSS before. When I ripped my own out and used Tailwind, I lit a fire on my productivity, I was happy I started using it.

### NextJS + Nextra

NextJS had a learning curve which I was impatient with, I really wanted to have this site up and running, but I wanted it to look good and function a little bit differently than the template.

Concepts I initially didn't understand were

- \_app.tsx and \_document.tsx files, both are injected into each page creation
- css modules, that came easily
- Images having their own component, can't use img tag - this is actually better because Images don't need to be compressed and auto lazy loading
- Links having their own component

Once I had the hang of NextJS I liked the routing, styles, page setup, image compression, and build process with Vercel.

I found a great document themed template called [Nextra](https://nextra.site) - this appears to be build by the Vercel team, [github.com/shuding](https://github.com/shuding) seems to have crated it and is the main contributor, thanks Shu Ding!
