## Summary

What is it?

Narrative: Web3 social

GM.xyz is a social platform for Web3 communities.

GM is the async communication hub for scaling Web3 communities.
PTSD from Discord, Telegram, Signal members, channels, chats, notificaitons.

## How does it work ?

GM borrows Reddit's sub-reddit and thread model... With

- Wallet sign-in
- Verified PFP's
- NFT Portfolio
- Gated communities based on assets such as DAO tokens or NFT's

## Why it's important ?

Web3 communities need a solution now.

### PTSD research on discord notifications or something similar

Current state is:

1. can't synthesize info from 10's/100's of discord/telegram/signal chats
2. it's so distracting
3. impossible to go back in time to previous info
4. bots dominate chat channels

## Why can't Reddit copy GM?

They could...
Keyword `could`

1. Reddit's been playing with Web3 utilities for some time - they have x, y, and z. GM started in August 2022 and has a b c x y z.
   The Web2 monopolies can't move as fast!
2. Reddit can't!


## GM current & future state

Current: building Web3 utilities in a Web2 app based on web2 architecture

1. Web 2 architecture is faster to build on
2. It's more important to have a good application & many users rather than a decentralized app & no users

## GM future state

### crypto native social

- you're at an ETH conference and want to connect with people there. Open your DM's only to users with the conference POAP
- you have a massive following, open your DM's for $10 a chat

### end to end DAO tooling

What does a DAO need?

- Async chat ()
- tokens (e.g. ERC 20/721/1115??)
- governance (e.g. )
- fund raising (e.g. )

### end to end community management

What does a decentralized community need?

- tangible incentives and rewards
- - most valuable contributors / contributions
- - who's inviting users, how engaged are their users
- - who's making posts, how engaged/popular are their posts
- - how can we compensate those community members
    (Have a look at Friends With Benefits)

## Paint a picture for me...

Power to the people!
Blogging =>

- Medium
- Substack
- Mirror.xyz

- - `Medium` owns the content, the platform, owns the newsletter, and charges me $70 a year to publish. Users need to spend $70 a year to read. $$ received = none.
- - `Substack` free platform for writing and publishing newsletters. Enables writers to charge a subscription
- - `Mirror.xyz` enables users to issue NFT's of their posts to purchase content. Writers can charge followers, writers can crowdfund new content they want to write

## How `Web3` is it?

GM's built on Web2 infrastructure, currrent focus is building something people love rather than building decentralzied something people don't want.

- decentralized
- open
- composable
