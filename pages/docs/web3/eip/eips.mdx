Changes to fee model

before

- First price auction
- Miners sort by highest gas price
- MetaMask enables slow, average, fast preferences
- not ideal for users & expensive during peak times
- Payment to miner = block reward + gas fee
- Miner receives block reward + gas fee

problems

- Predictable transaction fees
- Delays in transaction processing
- Confusing fee bidding system & unprocessed transactions
-

after

- Base fee is set per block based on how congested the network is
- Block size can be doubled from 12.5M Gwei to 25M Gwei causing the base fee to increase
- Base fee can increase by 12.5% per block
- Miner tip to incentivize miners to include transaction
- Payment to miner = block reward + base fee + tip
- Miner receives block reward + tip

differences

- Less profit for miners
- More network activity = more eth burnt = less Eth in circulation
- Make gas fee lower? no
