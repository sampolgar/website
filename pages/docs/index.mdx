# About

import Image from 'next/image';
import { OneImage } from '../../components/images/images.tsx';
export const navigation = '/images/docs';

I believe in transparency and "building in public".

I'll use this doc page and the search function for tools, frameworks, or links I use or things I forget, also for sharing with others.

...

On a side note, here's GitHub copilot's suggestion for this page:

<OneImage src={`${navigation}/index-joke.png`} caption='' />
