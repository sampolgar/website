## recursion

When should a recursive algorithm

1. not return anything
2. return the result of the algorithm
3. return the algorithm itself

I've been confused about this and realised it's something I needed to solidify.

### 1. Not return anything

A function that doesn't return is used to perform an action on an existing data structure or global variable.
For example, `reverse a string` or `print a list`

```python
def reverse_string(string):
    if len(string) == 0:
        return ""
    return string[-1] + reverse_string(string[:-1])

print(reverse_string("hello world"))
# dlrow olleh
```

```python
def print_list(list):
    if len(list) == 0:
        return
    print(list[0])
    print_list(list[1:])

print_list(["hello", "world"])
# hello
# world
```

#### How it works

Notice how the reversed string uses the memory stack to build the string
The first function returns the reversed string in 1 go, where the second function returns the first element, then the second element.
This is recursion, the first function continues to run until it reaches the base case, then it returns the reversed string, it's saved the string values in the memory stack.

### 2. return the result of the algorithm

Returning the function itself allows you to maintain the state of the function as you recurse until a base case is reached, then you can return the result of the algorithm.

```python
def recursive_function(data):
    # do some processing on data
    new_data = data + 1
    if new_data < 10:
        return recursive_function(new_data)
    else:
        return data
```

#### How it works

The state of the data is maintained as the function recurses (like a global variable).
The function will continue to recurse until the base case is reached, then it will return the result of the algorithm.

### 3. return the algorithm itself

This is the most confusing for me because I'm thinking about variables.

- Don't think about variables, think about the call stack
- If you're returning the algorithm itself, you're returning the call stack
- The call stack will grow until the base case, then it will start popping off the stack

For example, the factorial funciton multiplies itself by the number below.
`if n = 5, then F(5) = 5 x F(4)....`
How can we represent this in a function?

```python
def recursive_factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * recursive_factorial(n-1)
```

#### How it works

The call stack will retain the state of the function until the base case. It won't be returning each result as it recurses through.
Given the example above, the call stack will look like this

```
factorial(5) --> adds frame 1 to call stack
    factorial(4) --> adds frame 2 to call stack
        factorial(3) --> adds frame 3 to call stack
            factorial(2) --> adds frame 4 to call stack
                factorial(1) --> adds frame 5 to call stack
                    factorial(0) --> returns 1, pops frame 5 from call stack
                return 1 * 1 = 1, pops frame 4 from call stack
            return 2 * 1 = 2, pops frame 3 from call stack
        return 3 * 2 = 6, pops frame 2 from call stack
    return 4 * 6 = 24, pops frame 1 from call stack
```

All of this is the `recursive_factorial(n-1)` part of the function.
When we `return n * recursive_factorial(n-1)` we are actually returning
`n * ` the call stack above. This is why we don't need to create a variable to store the result of the recursive function, we can just return it because the recursive function is the result.

#### recursion return
using `return` inside a recursive function is used to exit the function.
If you don't use `return` inside a recursive function, it will continue to recurse until the base case is reached.

```python


```

```

```
