# Git cheat sheet

## Create Repo

- `git init`
- `git commit -am "first commit"` | `git add . && git commit -m "first commit"`
- `git branch -M main`
- `git remote add origin` / `git remote add upstream https://github.com/sampolgar/.../.git`
- `git pull main --allow-unrelated-histories`

## commands

#### useful

- `git status`
- `git remote -v`
- `git rm -r --cached .`
- `git add . && git commit -m "" && git push origin main`

### branching

- `git branch` | `git branch -r`
- `git branch new-feature`
- `git checkout main`
- `git checkout -b new-feature`
- `git branch -d branch-name` delete local branch, branch must be comitted
- or `git branch -D branch-name` delete branch, doesn't need commit. Ensure I'm on the branch

## Global Setup

- `git config --global init.default Branch main`
- `git config --global user.email "sampolgar@gmail.com"`
- `ls -la | see in the file structure`
- `rm -rf .git/ | delete the git init file`

## Revert or Reset

- `git log --oneline --graph --author="sampolgar@gmail.com"` | easily see the commit history
- reset undoes commits, revert undoes commits and creates a new commit
- `git reset --hard HEAD~5` || `git reset --hard hashofmerge_commit` | reset the last commit, or
- `git reset --soft HEAD~1` || `git reset --soft hasofmerge_commit` | reset the last commit, but keep the changes
- `git revert HEAD` || `git revert HEAD~2` || `git revert HEAD~4..HEAD~1` || `git revert hasofmerge_commit -m parentNumber` | revert

Revert a commit

Revert changes, git push origin -f closes a PR and reverts any changes => you can edit them and push a new PR

Revert a pushed commit

## Update or sync a forked Repo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deEYHVpE1c8)

- `git remote add upstream https://github.com/whoever/whatever.git` | Add the remote, call it "upstream":
- `git fetch upstream` | Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches
- `git checkout main` | make sure I'm on main
- `git rebase upstream/main` | Rewrite your master branch so that any commits of yours that aren't already in upstream/main are replayed on top of that other branch:
  `If you don't want to rewrite the history of your main branch, (for example because other people may have cloned it) then you should replace the last command with git merge upstream/main.`
  `However, for making further pull requests that are as clean as possible, it's probably better to rebase.`
- `git push -f origin main` | push the changes to my forked repo, use `-f` the first time after rebase

## sam can you revert your last commit in the PR?

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36168839/how-to-remove-commits-from-a-pull-request

Removing commits that you want to delete

- git checkout my-pull-request-branch
- git rebase -i HEAD~n
- pick commits to keep, drop commits to discard
- git push --force

If you drop all commits in the PR it will close the PR

- git rebase -i HEAD~n
- swap the commit you want to remove to the bottom (most recent) position
- git reset HEAD^ --soft
- git push -f

this should remove commit from remote and keep commit on local

## Unstash a few files

- `git stash pop` | pop everything
- `git add` | add what you want to keep
- `git stash --keep-index` | stash the rest
