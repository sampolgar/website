## js function reminder
### arrow 1
- `function` and const functions are almost the same.
- `async function greeter(greeting, name) {}` - same as
-  `const greeter = async (greeting, name) => {}` - same as
- `async (greeting, name) => {}`

### arrow 2
- preferred:`describe("hello", function() {})`
- not preferred: `describe("hello", () => {})`
