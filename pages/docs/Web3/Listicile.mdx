- Relationships (followers) are NFT's on Polygon between follower and followee
- Removes the need 
- Social graph used as a 
- Credit and reputation systems
- Not locked into a service provider - applications will be incentivised to provide the best experience

- Pay to follow, subscribe to follow, contribute to protocol
- Pay to follow a creator + follower collects fees from followers
- 

Current - Web 2

What is it
- Lens Protocol: A Decentralized Social Graph. Imagine Facebook's underlying infrastructure being open, transparent, and configurable by any application wanting to use it.

How it works
- Lens is a protocol (built with Smart Contracts) on Polygon
- Being a protocol means the team at Lens don't provide an application like the Facebook app for users to login and post/create content
- Being a protocol means anyone can create a website using Lens as the back-end engine to explore, follow, like, subscribe
- Lens uses NFT's to represent profiles, relationships, and content. Me being friends with you - that's an NFT. A post, that's an NFT

How it's different
- Users own their content
- Users own their relationships
- Offers features like content drops, content collection, creator funding

Why it's important?
Relationships
- Web2 platforms have you locked into a platform. Tweeters make Twitter valuable, but Tweeters aren't paid by Twitter. If a Tweeter wants to leave Twitter, they can't bring their audience with them.
- Lens relationships are tokenized and onchain and not owned or locked into a platform.
Content
- Similarly, your Tweets are on Twitter. Your Facebook posts are on... Facebook!
- Lens mints NFT's for content, your content is public and on-chain

How this changes the game? Web3 social changes how users interact with content
Algorithms
- Now: Twitter, Meta, Google etc, own/manage the algorithms that display content. The Web2 social graph is THE business model, it's a competition for 
a user's attention. Web2 platforms are incentivised to display content by advertisers
- - Limitation: Users on Twitter see advertising and users who promote their posts more than other content.
