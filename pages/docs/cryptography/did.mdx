# Notes on Decentralized Identity

## Pairwise DID

Web2 Identifiers are consistent for all applications. If your Microsoft User ID is 12345 then every application you sign in to has the same User ID.
Web3 Identifiers use "Pairwise DID" - the users wallet generates a new identifier for each application
Benefits of Pairwise DID:

- Privacy - the application does not know the users real identity
- Security - knowing a user in one application doesn't break security in another application
